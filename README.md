## Introduction
The [Steampunk Scanner] is a quality scanner for Ansible playbooks, where you can scan the playbook and get an instant 
quality score with tips on how to improve it.
The [steampunk-scanner] CLI enables the use of Ansible scanner from the console with the ability to scan Ansible task 
files, playbooks, roles and collections.

## Prerequisites
The `steampunk-scanner` requires Python 3 and a virtual environment. 
In a typical modern Linux environment, we should already be set. 
In Ubuntu, however, we might need to run the following commands:

```console
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install -y python3-venv python3-wheel python-wheel-common
```

## Installation
The `steampunk-scanner` CLI tool is available as a Python package, so the simplest way to test it, is to install it 
into a fresh Python virtual environment like this:

```console
$ python3 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
(.venv) $ pip install steampunk-scanner
```

The tool is available on PyPI as a package named [steampunk-scanner]. 
Apart from the latest [PyPI production] version, you can also find the latest [PyPI development] version, which 
includes pre-releases so that you will be able to test the latest features before they are officially released.

## Usage
After the CLI is installed, you can explore its commands and options by running `steampunk-scanner --help`. 

### Registration
To use the CLI you have to register a new or use your existing Steampunk Scanner user account.

To register a new user with your email use the `register` command like this:

```bash
(.venv) $ steampunk-scanner account register email@example.com
Password:
```

After that your account is still pending for activation. 
We will send you an email with an activation code, which you can use like that:

```bash
(.venv) $ steampunk-scanner account activate <activation code>
```

If everything goes okay you have successfully registered your Steampunk Scanner user account.
To use it for scanning, you should set `SCANNER_USERNAME` and `SCANNER_PASSWORD` environment variables and then you can
start scanning right away (you will be prompted for your credentials if you skip setting those env vars).

### Scanning
The CLI `scan` command is used for Ansible scanning and returning back the scan results. It accepts for different 
switches for different Ansible entities (tasks, playbooks, roles and collections).

```bash
# scan Ansible task file, which is just unindented `tasks` section of the playbook
(.venv) $ steampunk-scanner scan --tasks path/to/taskfile1.yaml [path/to/taskfile2.yaml ...]
# scan Ansible playbooks
(.venv) $ steampunk-scanner scan --playbooks path/to/playbook1.yaml [path/to/playbook2.yaml ...]
# scan Ansible playbooks with pattern matching
(.venv) $ steampunk-scanner scan --playbooks path/to/playbook/folder/play_*.yaml
# scan Ansible role (scan task files path/to/role1/tasks and path/to/role1/handlers)
(.venv) $ steampunk-scanner scan --roles path/to/role1 [path/to/role2 ...]
# scan Ansible collection (scan roles from path/to/collection1/roles/ and playbooks from path/to/collection1/playbooks/)
(.venv) $ steampunk-scanner scan --collection path/to/collection1 [path/to/collection2 ...]
# scan multiple Ansible entities at once
(.venv) $ steampunk-scanner scan --tasks path/to/taskfile1.yaml --playbooks path/to/playbook1.yaml --roles path/to/role1 --collection path/to/collection1
```

#### Tasks
Let us assume we have the following `taskfile.yaml` file:

```
 1 ---
 2 - name: Configure agent (Linux)
 3   include_tasks: linux/configure.yml
 4   when: ansible_facts.os_family != "Linux"
 5
 6 - name: Configure agent (Windows)
 7   include_tasks: windows/configure.yml
 8   when: ansible_facts.os_family == "Windows"
```

In this case, the CLI tool will report something like that back:

```bash
(.venv) $ steampunk-scanner scan --tasks taskfile.yaml
taskfile.yaml:2: HINT: The 'include_tasks' module is redirected to the 'ansible.builtin.include_tasks' module. You should use fully-qualified collection name to avoid future problems.
taskfile.yaml:6: HINT: The 'include_tasks' module is redirected to the 'ansible.builtin.include_tasks' module. You should use fully-qualified collection name to avoid future problems.
```

#### Playbooks
Let us assume we have the following Ansible playbook `playbook.yaml` file:

```
 1 ---
 2 - name: Sample playbook
 3   hosts: localhost
 4 
 5   collections:
 6     - sensu.sensu_go
 7     - ansible.builtin
 8 
 9   tasks:
10     - name: Create local user
11       usr:
12         name: johnmcclane
13 
14     - name: OpenStack info gathering
15       openstack.cloud.os_flavor_info:
```

In this case, the CLI tool will report something like that back:

```bash
(.venv) $ steampunk-scanner scan --playbooks playbook.yaml
playbook.yaml:10: ERROR: Cannot find module information in the database. Is this a custom module not published on Ansible Galaxy?
playbook.yaml:14: HINT: Module is deprecated. os_ prefixed module names are deprecated, use openstack.cloud.compute_flavor_info.
playbook.yaml:14: HINT: The 'openstack.cloud.os_flavor_info' module is redirected to the 'openstack.cloud.compute_flavor_info' module. You should use fully-qualified collection name to avoid future problems.
playbook.yaml:14: WARNING: The 'openstack.cloud.os_flavor_info' module is not certified.
```

#### Roles
Let us assume we have an Ansible role (for example from [Sensu Go Ansible Collection]) with the following structure:

```console
(.venv) $ tree sensu-go/roles/backend/
sensu-go/roles/backend/
├── defaults
│   └── main.yml
├── handlers
│   └── main.yml
├── meta
│   ├── argument_specs.yml
│   └── main.yml
├── README.md
├── tasks
│   ├── configure.yml
│   ├── main.yml
│   └── start.yml
├── templates
│   └── backend.yml.j2
└── vars
    └── main.yml
```

In this case, the CLI tool will scan `tasks` and `handlers` and report something like that back:

```bash
(.venv) $ steampunk-scanner scan --roles sensu-go/roles/backend/
sensu-go/roles/backend/tasks/start.yml:2: HINT: The 'service' module is redirected to the 'ansible.builtin.service' module. You should use fully-qualified collection name to avoid future problems.
sensu-go/roles/backend/tasks/start.yml:8: ERROR: 'cmd' is not a valid parameter.
sensu-go/roles/backend/tasks/start.yml:8: HINT: The 'command' module is redirected to the 'ansible.builtin.command' module. You should use fully-qualified collection name to avoid future problems.
sensu-go/roles/backend/tasks/start.yml:16: ERROR: 'cmd' is not a valid parameter.
sensu-go/roles/backend/tasks/start.yml:16: HINT: The 'command' module is redirected to the 'ansible.builtin.command' module. You should use fully-qualified collection name to avoid future problems.

sensu-go/roles/backend/tasks/main.yml:2: HINT: The 'include_role' module is redirected to the 'ansible.builtin.include_role' module. You should use fully-qualified collection name to avoid future problems.
sensu-go/roles/backend/tasks/main.yml:8: ERROR: 'manage_sensu_backend_service' is not a valid parameter.
sensu-go/roles/backend/tasks/main.yml:8: ERROR: 'key_value' is a required parameter.
sensu-go/roles/backend/tasks/main.yml:8: HINT: The 'set_fact' module is redirected to the 'ansible.builtin.set_fact' module. You should use fully-qualified collection name to avoid future problems.
sensu-go/roles/backend/tasks/main.yml:12: HINT: The 'include_tasks' module is redirected to the 'ansible.builtin.include_tasks' module. You should use fully-qualified collection name to avoid future problems.

sensu-go/roles/backend/handlers/main.yml:2: HINT: The 'service' module is redirected to the 'ansible.builtin.service' module. You should use fully-qualified collection name to avoid future problems.
```

#### Collections
Let us assume we have an Ansible collection (for instance [Sensu Go Ansible Collection]) with the following structure:

```
(.venv) $ ls -l sensu-go/
total 116
drwxrwxr-x 2 user user  4096 Sep  6 09:28 changelogs
-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user  8589 Sep  6 09:28 CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user     7 Sep  6 09:28 collection.requirements
-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user 35148 Sep  6 09:28 COPYING
drwxrwxr-x 2 user user  4096 Sep  6 09:28 docker

-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user   529 Sep  6 09:28 galaxy.yml
-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user   348 Sep  6 09:28 integration.requirements
-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user  2828 Sep  6 09:28 Makefile

drwxrwxr-x 5 user user  4096 Sep 28 10:20 roles
-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user   182 Sep  6 09:28 sanity.requirements
drwxrwxr-x 5 user user  4096 Sep  6 09:28 tests
drwxrwxr-x 2 user user  4096 Sep  6 09:28 tools
drwxrwxr-x 3 user user  4096 Sep  6 09:28 vagrant
```

In this case, the CLI tool will scan `roles` and `playbooks` and report something like that back:

```bash
(.venv) $ steampunk-scanner scan --collections sensu-go
sensu-go/roles/backend/tasks/start.yml:2: HINT: The 'service' module is redirected to the 'ansible.builtin.service' module. You should use fully-qualified collection name to avoid future problems.
