# Steampunk Scanner CLI (archived)

This project archives the very first version of Steampunk Scanner CLI, which has 
been later renamed to Steampunk Spotter CLI because Steampunk Scanner has been
relabelled to [Steampunk Spotter].

The source has been moved to GitLab ([gitlab.com/xlab-steampunk/spotter-cli]).
The CLI Python package has been renamed to [steampunk-spotter].
Installing the old [steampunk-scanner] Python package will now install 
[steampunk-spotter] Python package.

[Steampunk Spotter] provides an Assisted Automation Writing tool that analyzes 
and offers recommendations for your Ansible Playbooks.
The Steampunk Spotter CLI enables the use from the console with the ability 
to scan Ansible content such as playbooks, roles, collections or task files.

## Acknowledgement
This tool was created by [XLAB Steampunk], IT automation specialist and 
leading expert in building Enterprise Ansible Collections.
